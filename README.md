# MultithreadingSimulator

## Overview
<p>This is a simple simulator for multithreading in operating system which is developed using java. The warehouse process is used in this program to simulate the process of multithreading in operating system.</p>

#### Workflow
There are two items, namely item A and B, and the program will randomly generate them. After the item is generated, it will then be moved to the sorter, and the sorter will add the item into a storage bag (bag A or B) according to the type of item. Once the storage bag reaches the maximum capacity (10 items per bag), the relative dispatcher (dispatcher A or B) will then move the bag to the conveyor, and a new supply of the bag will be added.
